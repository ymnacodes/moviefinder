EVENING
1
A
young
COUPLE
stand
alone
on
a
dock.
They’re
dressed
elegantly
for
a
big
night
out.
MARGOT
stares
off,
a
little
bored.
TYLER
drums
his
hand
against
his
leg.
His
eyes
dart
around,
a
little
panicked.
TYLER
What
time
is
it?
Margot
looks
at
her
watch
nonchalantly.
MARGOT
It
is...6:26.
TYLER
Shit.
MARGOT
Tyler,
relax.
TYLER
No,
sweetie,
this
is
bad.
MARGOT
I’m
sure
it’s
fine,
babe.
TYLER
Well,
where
is
everybody?
MARGOT
You’re
positive
we’re
in
the
right
place?
TYLER
Yes.
I
followed
the
directions
on
the
website
exactly.
MARGOT
Okay,
well,
then
reset
the
mood.
We’ve
still
got
four
minutes.
Tyler
nods,
but
he’s
unconvinced.
Margot
lights
a
cigarette.
Tyler
notices
and
grimaces
disapprovingly.
TYLER
Babe,
please
don’t
smoke.
It’ll
kill
your
palette.

MARGOT
Then
my
palette
will
die
happy.
TYLER
Hey.
(insistent)
Margot.
Tyler’s
tone
stops
Margot
in
her
tracks.
She
looks
at
him.
The
mood
is
suddenly
a
little
tense.
He’s
dead
serious.
TYLER
(CONT'D)
Tonight
is
huge,
okay?
The
flavor
profiles
-
it’s
all
super
delicate.
When
you
smoke,
you
ruin
your
ability
to
appreciate
them.
(beat)
Please.
After
an
edgy
silence,
Margot
stamps
out
her
cigarette.
MARGOT
Fine.
Jesus.
TYLER
Thank
you.
A
FOGHORN
blows
close
by,
startling
both
of
them.
A
small
but
gorgeously
appointed
BOAT
pulls
into
the
harbor.
TYLER
(CONT'D)
Thank
God.
MARGOT
Is
that
gonna
fit
everyone?
TYLER
Easily.
12
customers
total.
MARGOT
A
night?
How
do
they
turn
a
profit?
TYLER
850
a
head,
that’s
how.
Margot
nearly
does
a
double-take.
MARGOT
You’re
fucking
joking
right?
TYLER
C’mon,
let’s
not
ruin
this
by
talking
price,
yeah?
Just
go
with
the
flow.
Let
it
be
magical.

Margot
just
chuckles
and
shrugs.
MARGOT
Hey,
it’s
your
dime.
A
MERCEDES
pulls
into
the
dock
and
parks.
THREE
RICH
TECH-
NERD
BROS
in
their
30s
and
40s--
BRYCE,
SOREN,
DAVE--
get
out,
a
little
drunk,
a
little
rowdy.
BRYCE
--just
such
a
fuck-you

Accounts.
It’s
not
even
a
client
dinner!
They
all
laugh.
Tyler
looks
at
them
with
distaste.
TYLER
Great.
A
power
tasting.
They’ll
be
wasted
by
the
amuse.
Margot
sees
an
OLDER
COUPLE
getting
out
of
a
Town
Car.
RICHARD
(60s)
gets
the
door
for
his
wife
ANNE
(also
60s).
As
he
does,
he
turns
and
briefly
locks
eyes
with
Margot.
He
seems
to
recognize
her.
Margot’s
eyes
dart
away
instantly.
MARGOT
(under
her
breath)
Fuck.
TYLER
What?
MARGOT
Huh?
Nothing.
A
finely
dressed
BOATMAN
lowers
a
gangway
on
the
boat.
BOATMAN
All
aboard
for
Hawthorn!
TYLER
I
have
to
log
every
nuance
of
this.
To
silkscreen
it
on
my
brain.
Most
guests
have
now
arrived.
They
file
on
the
boat,
showing
tickets
on
their
phones.
As
Tyler
and
Margot
queue,
Tyler
notices
someone
behind
them
and
averts
his
eyes.
TYLER
(CONT'D)
Ho-ly
fucking
shit.
Don’t
look.
MARGOT

Who’s
Lillian

TYLER
Shh,
just

food

Saveur.
Play

MARGOT
You’re

TYLER
She’s
running
her

I
bet
this
makes
the
top

She
doesn’t

We
SWING

TYLER
I

I
have
to
say:
I’m
weirdly
nervous.
MARGOT
To
eat
dinner?
TYLER
Right?
It’s
crazy.
MARGOT
No,
it’s
cute.
(sees

Oh
wow.
Check
it
out.
I
loved
him
when
I
was
a
kid.
TYLER
Oh
yeah.
Apparently
he’s
a
big
foodie.
Or
you
know
-
thinks
he
is.
MARGOT
He
looks
kinda
like

A
WAITER

Chef
Slowik
would
like
to
welcome
you
with
a
raw
local
oyster
in
a
mignonette
emulsion,
with
lemon
caviar
and
an
oyster
leaf.
Enjoy.
Tyler
and
Margot
take
their
trays.
TYLER
Beautiful.
Thank
you.
The
waiters

Margot
stares
at

tray.
TYLER

TYLER
Oh

It’s

It’s
actually
fucking
laughably
good.
Margot
cautiously
tries
it
and
nods
her
head.
MARGOT
Mmm.
It’s
good.
I’d
be
happy
with
just
the
oyster,
though.
I
love
oysters.
TYLER
No,
no,
it’s
the
balance
of
the
products.
You
need
the
mouthfeel
of
the
mignonette.
MARGOT
(smiles)
Please
don’t
say
‘mouthfeel.’

Bullshit.

LILLIAN

Yes,

if
I
have
to
eat
one
more
deconstructed
avant
cassoulet
whatever
I’m
gonna
puke.
So
I
leave

stop
at
a

a
block
away.
And...

manning

Julian

I
almost
fall
to
my
knees
and
start
believing
in
God.
And
I
get
him
to
agree
to
an
interview.
TED
That’s
the
famous
piece
Lillian
wrote
about
him.
Culinary
hagiography.
Calvin
Trillin
meets
Gregory
of
Tours.
LILLIAN
BLOOM
Stop.
Anyway,
suddenly
every
foodie
investor
is
hounding
him.
He
says
he’ll
consider
it
on
three
conditions.
One,
complete
privacy.
Two,
land
to
forage
and
plant.
Three,
it
has
to
be
by
the
water
so
he
can
source
his
own
fish.
That’s
when
Doug
Verrick
swoops
in
and
offers
him
a
fucking
island.
TED
Thanks

your

This

The

When

smiles
coldly.
ELSA
Welcome

Westervelt?
Elsa

puzzled.
Margot,
equally
puzzled,
looks

Oh,

Welcome.
We’ll
endeavor

make
your

Right

Elsa
ushers
them
ahead.
Tyler
whispers
to
Margot:
TYLER
Sorry.
That
was,

That
was
a
little
awkward.
MARGOT

It’s
fine.
The
boat
leaves.
Margot,
it
seems,
is
the
only
who
notices
it
leave.
She
looks
longingly
at
it
as
it
sails
away.
And
then
she
looks
at
this
island.
No

She
snaps
out

it.
Nearby,

The

He

MARGOT
I

you
didn’t
ask

TYLER
Shh.
There
he
is.
We
get
our
first
glimpse
of
the
man
himself:
CHEF
JULIAN
SLOWIK(40s/50s),
brooding,
intense.
Utterly
focused,
he
glides
swiftly
from

tasting.
Elsa
approaches
Chef
Slowik
and
talks
softly
to
him.
We
don’t
hear
what
is
said,
but
he
looks
in
Margot’s

the
great
chef
and
his
guest
share
a
type
of
recognition

a
sadness
perhaps?
A
longing?
Chef
tersely
breaks
eye

and
resumes

The

continue
to

I’ve
watched

twenty

I’ve
watched
him
explain
the
exact
moment
at
which
a
green
strawberry
is
perfectly
unripe.
I’ve
watched
him
plate
a
raw
scallop
during
its

It’s

Here

what
you
must
remember
about
this
dish.
We,
the
people
on
this
island,
are
not
important.
The
island
and
the
nutrients
it
provides
exist
in
their
most
perfect
state
without
us
gathering
them,
manipulating
them
or
digesting
them.
What
happens
inside
this
room
is
meaningless
compared
to
what
occurs
outside,
in
nature,
in
the
soil
and
the
water
and
the
air.
We
are

Nature
is
timeless.

Oh

TYLER
This

Bread
has
existed
in
some
form
for
over
12,000
years,
especially
amongst
the
poor.
Flour
and
water.
What
could
be
simpler?
Even
today,
grain
represents
65%
of
all
agriculture.
Fruits
and
vegetables?
Only
6%.
Ancient
Greek
peasants
dipped
their
stale,
measly
bread
in
wine
for
breakfast.
And
how
did
Jesus
teach
us
to
pray
if
not
to
beg
for
“our
daily
bread?”
It
is,

CHEF

The
next
course
is
called
“Memory.”
That’s
what
it’s
meant
to
evoke
--
a
memory.
Let
me
tell
you
one
of
mine.
When
I
was
a
child
growing
up
in
Waterloo,
Iowa,
Tuesday
was
taco
night.
Taco
Tuesday!
The
guests
smile,
but
his
enthusiasm
feels
forced
and
odd.
Chef
Slowik
puts
his
hand
on
Linda’s
shoulder.
CHEF
SLOWIK
(CONT'D)
This
is
my
mother.
As
you
can
see,
she
is
rather
drunk.
This
is
not
unusual.
When
I
was
seven
years
old,
one
Tuesday
my
father
came
home
quite
drunk.
Also
not
unusual.
Mother
grew
angry
and
screamed
at
him.
At
which
point
he
proceeded
to
wrap
a
telephone
cord
around
her
neck
and
pull
it
tight.
I
wept
and
screamed
and
begged
him
to
stop.
To
make
him
stop,
I
finally
had
to
stab
him
in
the
thigh
with
kitchen
scissors.
You
remember
that,
mother,
don’t
you?
Linda
reacts
vaguely,
continues
drinking.
CHEF
SLOWIK
(CONT'D)
I
suppose
I
should
have
stabbed
him
in
his
throat
that
evening.
But
we
are
not
so
smart
when
we
are
young.

“Don’t

intently
and
with
empathy,
as

understanding
his
pain.
Noticing,
Chef
locks
eyes
with
her
and
says
the
next
line
directly
to
her.
CHEF
SLOWIK
(CONT'D)
Well.
It
was,
as
you
can
imagine,
a
very
memorable
taco
night.
Servers
appear
and
set
down
plates
fashioned
out
of
coiled
telephone
cords,
as
well
as
bowls
of
tortillas.
On
the
plates
are
chicken
thighs
with
TINY
SCISSORS
sticking
out
of
them.
A
SUPERIMPOSED
TITLE
reads:
“MEMORY.
Marinated
grilled
chicken
thigh,
tortillas,
green
salsa
cubes,
red
salsa
halo.”
CHEF

Here
you
have
house-smoked
Bresse
chicken
thighs
al
pastor
and
our
own
tortillas
made
with
heirloom
masa--one
of
Hawthorn’s
signature
dishes.
We
change
our
menu
constantly,
but,
as
Miss

knows,
this
has
been
a
staple
since

would
that

lets
this
rhetorical
question
hang
in
the
air.
CHEF

Anyways,
because
we

update
to
a

have
been
made

We

us
all.

“The

JEREMY
Yes,

CHEF
SLOWIK
Originally
from
Sparks,
Nevada,
Jeremy
studied
at
the
Culinary
Institute
in
Hyde

Jeremy’s
goal,
as
he
wrote
in
a
heartfelt
letter,
was
to
work
for
me
here
at
Hawthorn.
Isn’t
that

Jeremy?
JEREMY
Yes,
Chef.
CHEF

Jeremy
is
talented.
He’s
good.
He’s
very
good.
But
he’s
not
great.
He
will
never
be
great.
He
desperately
wants
my
job,
my
prestige.
My
talent.
He
aspires
to
greatness,
but
he
will
never
achieve
it.

Jeremy

He
has
forsaken

to
achieve
his
goals.
He
works
twenty
hours
a

No

He
can’t
go

time
you
called
your
mother?
JEREMY
I
don’t
remember,
Chef.
CHEF
SLOWIK
Like
mine,
his
life
is
pressure.
Pressure
to
put
out
the
best
food
in
the
world.
Pressure
to
please
his
Chef.
Pressure
to
please
the

And
the
critics.
And
even
when
all
goes
right,
and
the
food
is
perfect,
and
the
customers
are
happy,
and
the

are

there
is
no

The

The
Mess
you
make

of
your
sanity,
by
giving
everything
you
have

right.
I
shouldn’t
be
here
tonight.
And
I
say
this
with
respect
because
I’m
sure
you’re
quite
brilliant
but
all
of
this

it
wasn’t
meant

me.
Chef

disappointed

flattery.
CHEF
SLOWIK
You’re
not
sure
I’m
brilliant,
so
don’t
say
it.
It’s
tacky.
False.
Margot
flinches.
MARGOT
Fine
then.
I’m
not
sure
you’re
brilliant.
CHEF
SLOWIK
Sloppy.
MARGOT
Fuck
you.
CHEF
SLOWIK
Sloppy

I
was
expecting
more.
I
guess
I
have
to
make
your
decision
for
you:
You
belong
here,
with
your
own
breed.
MARGOT
What

is
that?
CHEF

You’ve

all

MARGOT
Well?
I

you
know.
Chef

nods.
CHEF
SLOWIK
So,
he
paid
for
an
experience.
And
I
can
tell,
from
one
provider
of
experiences
to
another,
that
you
don’t
rattle
easily.
So
how
did
he
rattle
you.
MARGOT
It’s
not--
CHEF
SLOWIK
Margot.
A
moment.
MARGOT
He
told
me
to
agree
with
everything
he
said,
and
not
break
eye
contact
while
he
jerked
off.
CHEF
SLOWIK
Uh
huh.
Specific.
MARGOT
Not
really.
It’s
pretty
unoriginal.
What
rattled
me
was
that
he
told
me
to
tell
him
he
was
a
good
man,
and
that
I
was
his
daughter
and
that
I
loved
him
and
then
he--
Chef
cuts
her
off.
CHEF
SLOWIK
So
he’s
a
romantic.
They

KATHERINE
Good

everyone.
I
have
a
story
for
you
all.
Three
years
ago,
Julian
Slowik
tried
to
fuck
me.

nods
slightly

remains

refused
his

again.

“That
would
be
unethical,”
he
thought.
So
he
kept
me
in
his
kitchen
and
refused
to
look
me
in
the
eye
or
speak
directly
to
me
for
eight
months.
He
can
do
that.
Because
he’s
the

He’s
the
man.
Chef
Slowik
looks
away,
a
bit
pained.
KATHERINE

Which
mean
he
gets
to
be
the
dark
romantic

who
suffers
for
his
art.
A
woman
chef
is
a
trooper.
A

She’s
a
mother

She
makes
grandma’s
recipes
with
a
sly
modern
twist.

Isn’t

Diners

LILLIAN

nods.
KATHERINE
(CONT'D)
I
have
been
groped,
I
have
been
leered
at,
I
have
earned
more
but
made
less,
and
all
of
it
in
the
service
of
men
so
enraptured
with
themselves
that
they
don’t
see
their
own
pointlessness.
So
let’s
help
them
see.
(sincerely
warm)
Our
next
course
is
called
”Man’s
Folly.”
Katherine
approaches
Chef
and
stands
very
close,
looking
him
right
in
the
eyes.
She
pulls
a
small
PAIR
OF
SCISSORS
from
her
apron
and
stabs
him
in
the
thigh.
He
accepts
it
with
a
wince
and
a
nod.
Katherine
and
Chef
Slowik
share
a
long,
meaningful
hug.
Theirs
is
a
deep
understanding
that
we’ll
never
know.
CHEF
SLOWIK
(a
whisper)
I’m
sorry.
Katherine
smiles
at
him.
He
smiles
back
and
pulls
the
knife
from
his
thigh.
A
SERVER
is
there
with
a
tray
with
a
little

on
it

take

No,

a

I

that.
May
I

Margot

defeated.

Dessert

a
large

Do
you
see
a

MARGOT
(weary

No.
No,
I
do
not
see
a
barrel.
CHEF
SLOWIK
Neither
do
I.
That
is
because
my
negligent

Elsa
forgot
to
assign
someone
to
bring
it.
Elsa,

(stumbling

Um,
yes,
hi.
How
are
you?
Or
--
well,
I
just,
wanted
to
say,
because
-
and
I’m
not
trying
to
sound
all,
whatever
here
or
anything,
but
it’s
just
-
I
just
-
I
don’t
think
it’s
really,
totally
fair,
maybe,
what’s
happening
here?
So
-
?
But,
yeah.
(quick,
panicked
breath)
My
point
is,
we’re
all
people,
you
know?
And
people
are
people
-
obviously
-
and
if
the
people
of,
you
know,
of
the
world,
I
guess,
could
all
see
each
other
as
people,
then
maybe
-
you
see
what
I’m
saying?
It’s
like
-
divisions.
There
are
just
such,
we
have
so
many
divisions,
nowadays,
I
think?
Um,
and
it’s
so...
But
it’s
like,
fuck,
don’t
kill
people,
you
know?
I
know
that
sounds
totally,
‘Yeah,
no
shit’
-
but
also,
like?
I
do
think
we
should
all
just
-
you
know?
That’s
how
I
feel.
At
least.
Anyway.
Just,
please
don’t
kill
Felicity,
okay?
I
mean,
that
would
be,
just
-
come
on,
don’t
do
that.
And...
yeah.
He
quickly
sits
down.

But
Elsa

It’s

It’s

Death

nothing.
I’m

I
work
with
death
every

Death
is
my

How
can
I
call
myself
a

I

experience
death

myself?
Margot

Chef

CHEF

I
thought
about
your
question.
Here
is
the
answer.
I
am
a
monster.
No,
was
a
monster.
And
a
whore.
But
tonight
everything
I’m
doing
is
pure.
Egoless.
And
at
last,
the
pain
is
almost
gone.
There’s
a
CANDLE
on
Margot’s
table.
Chef
Slowik
extends
his
hand
directly
over
it.
The
flame
burns
his
flesh,
but
he
doesn’t
so
much
as
flinch.
CHEF

Chef’s
Hands.
“Asbestos

I
can
carry
a
cast-iron
from
a
hot
oven
to
your
table
with
no
protection.
That’s
a
cook’s
training.
He
snuffs
the
candle
with
his
thumb
and
forefinger.
CHEF

I
can
no
longer
be
hurt,

As
Dr.
King
said,
“We

that
freedom
is
never
voluntarily
given
by
the
oppressor.
It
must
be
demanded
by

oppressed.”

ties
a

The

You

ask
him
for

To
plead,
even.
This

be
unwise.
He
cannot

you.
The

exchange
conspiratorial

let
this
opportunity

CHEF

I
see
you
don’t
believe
me.
You
think
this
might
be
your
only
chance.
But
ask
yourselves
two
questions:
One,
if
you
really
want
to
be
responsible
for
the
death
of
an
innocent
man.
And
two,
ask
yourselves
--
this
entire
evening,
why
didn’t
you
all
try
harder
to
fight
back?
To
get
out

Honestly,
you
probably
could
have.
The

look
around.
He’s

Why
didn’t
they?
CHEF

Anyway,

MARGOT
You’ve
taken
the
joy
out
of
eating.
Every
dish
we’ve
had
tonight
was
some
intellectual
exercise
rather
than
something
you
just
want
to
sit
and
enjoy.
The
COOKS
can’t
believe
what
she’s
saying,
even
if
deep
down
they
know
there’s
a
kernel
of
truth
to
it.
Chef
Slowik
and
Margot
face
each
other
squarely
in
the
dining
room,
like
a
sort
of
final
showdown.
MARGOT
(CONT'D)
When
I
eat
your
food,
it
tastes
like
it
was
made
with
no
love.
SLOWIK
That
is
ridiculous.
I
always
cook
with
love.
Everyone
knows
love
is
the
most
important
ingredient.
MARGOT
You’re
kidding
yourself.
Chef
reacts.
MARGOT
(CONT'D)
Isn’t
tonight
a
night
where
we
face
some
hard,
home
truths?
You
cook
with
obsession,
not
love.
Chef
is
silent.
This
hits.
MARGOT
(CONT'D)
Even
your
hot
dishes
are
cold.
And
dead.
Like
they
were
made
by
one
of
those
fish
hanging
in

You’re

And

The

The

How

it?
MARGOT
Medium.
American

CHEF
SLOWIK
American
cheese
is
the
best
cheese
for
a
cheeseburger
because
it
melts
without
splitting.
MARGOT
And
no

mayo,
and
hot

MARGOT
That
sounds
weird.
CHEF
SLOWIK
You
want
it.
It’s
delicious.
MARGOT
How
much

The

of

Slowik
is
alone
in
the
kitchen.
The
entire
staff
has
gathered
in
the
dining
room.
The
tension
in
the
room
has
oddly
dissipated.
Margot
waits
patiently.
Chef
emerges
from
the
kitchen
and,
sloshing
across
the
liquid
still
covering
the
floor,
places
a
plate
in
front
of
her.
It
looks,
no

like
the
best
cheeseburger
ever.
A
SUPERIMPOSED
TITLE
reads,
“SUPPLEMENTAL
COURSE:
‘A
CHEESEBURGER
-
just
a
well-made
cheeseburger”
Margot
looks
at
it
and
nods.
Then
she
picks
it
up
and
takes
a
bite.
She
closes
her
eyes
and
savors
the
bite
for
a
long
glorious
beat.
Then
she
opens
her
eyes
and
looks
at
Chef.
MARGOT
Now
that
is
a
cheeseburger.
CHEF
SLOWIK
Yes.
That
is
a
cheeseburger.
They
smile
and
share
this
moment.
Margot
takes
a
deep
breath.

Unfortunately,
my

were

The

of

The
havoc
he
has
caused.
The
totality

his

And

to
his

gazing

into

Hawthorn

then
the

But

Finally,
nothing

the

Margot
sits
and
gazes
silently
at
the
distant
fire.
She
takes
the
cheeseburger
from
the

eats
it
as
she
watches
Hawthorn

a

SLOWIK,
perhaps
at
his
first
summer
job
at
a
fast

He
has
a
big
smile
on
his
face
and
an
apron
that
reads
“Kiss

Chef.”
He’s
never
been
happier,
his
face
lit
by
the
fire
of
the
grill.
And
he’s
flipping
the
world’s
most
perfect
cheeseburger.
